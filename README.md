# Python
collection of simple examples 
These were created a while ago and it seems that I need to add instructions on how to work with these.
I use Geany 1.37.1 under Linux and the examples in DataIntro work straight away. 
To use the turtle examples in boxes3.py we need to add libraries.

On Linux consider performing 
  sudo  sudo apt-get install python-tk

 working graphics prog is redstar.py
  then perhaps python3.py
